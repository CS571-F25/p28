                           <p><b>Home:</b> Create and organize your tasks. Start by making Tabs based on whatever category you want (e.g. by class, priority, type of task). Then, in each tab, you can create tasks with titles, descriptions, and dates. Tabs and Tasks can be customized with colors. If you change your mind about a task location, feel free to drag it to any other tab. </p>
                           <p><b>Weekly Calendar:</b> View tasks by week. Tasks with specific dates will be automatically displayed in the calendar. The calendar provides a way to visualize your week or month.</p>
                           <p><b>Study Session:</b> Start focused study sessions. Start by adding tasks from your home page into a study session. This allows you to focus on a specific set of tasks for a designated amount of time. Once you start your timer, work on your tasks and check them off as you go, good luck!</p>
                           <p><b>Profile:</b> Manage account info and view monthly activity. This is where you can view your personal information and stats. You can check out your total tasks completed and your most productive days. </p>
